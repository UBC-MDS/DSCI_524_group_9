## Package Overview
`pygtracker` is a Python package that allows UBC lecturers to record, analyze and adjust grades for students in a particular program. Users can record grades from each course, generate a summary report to determine which class is more challenging than the rest, or identify students who may need help. Finally, the package can suggest ways to adjust the grades for students to ensure the average grade matches a predefined benchmark. It contains five functions: `register_courses`, `record_grades`, `summarize_courses`, `rank_students` and `suggest_grade_adjustment`.
